# NDIS Connect - Technical Decisions

## Architecture Decisions

### State Management: Provider over BLoC/Riverpod
**Decision**: Use Provider for state management
**Rationale**: 
- Simpler learning curve for team
- Sufficient for current app complexity
- Good Flutter ecosystem support
- Easy to migrate to Riverpod later if needed

### Navigation: go_router over Navigator 2.0
**Decision**: Use go_router for navigation
**Rationale**:
- Declarative routing approach
- Built-in deep linking support
- Type-safe route definitions
- Better testability
- Future-proof navigation solution

### Design System: Custom over Material Design
**Decision**: Build custom design system on Material Design 3
**Rationale**:
- NDIS-specific accessibility requirements
- Consistent brand experience
- Token-based approach for maintainability
- High contrast and reduced motion support

## UI/UX Decisions

### Accessibility-First Design
**Decision**: Prioritize accessibility in all design decisions
**Rationale**:
- NDIS participants have diverse accessibility needs
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance required
- Legal compliance requirements
- Better user experience for all users

### 4px Grid System
**Decision**: Use 4px base unit for spacing
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with Material Design
- Easy to calculate and maintain
- Works well with 8px and 16px touch targets
- Scales well across different screen sizes

### High Contrast Mode
**Decision**: Implement high contrast mode
**Rationale**:
- Essential for users with visual impairments
- Increases contrast ratios to 7:1
- Bolder borders and shadows
- Enhanced font weights

## Technical Decisions

### Flutter Version: 3.24.0+
**Decision**: Target Flutter 3.24.0 and above
**Rationale**:
- Latest stable features
- Better performance improvements
- Enhanced accessibility support
- Long-term support commitment

### Android Target SDK: 36
**Decision**: Target Android API 36
**Rationale**:
- Latest Android features
- Better security and privacy controls
- Enhanced accessibility APIs
- Future-proofing for new Android versions

### iOS Target: 12.0+
**Decision**: Support iOS 12.0 and above
**Rationale**:
- Covers 95%+ of active iOS devices
- Balance between features and compatibility
- Reasonable development effort
- Good user coverage

## Performance Decisions

### Image Optimization
**Decision**: Use cached_network_image for network images
**Rationale**:
- Automatic caching and optimization
- Memory-efficient loading
- Built-in placeholder support
- Error handling included

### List Performance
**Decision**: Use ListView.builder for all lists
**Rationale**:
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Memory efficient
- Smooth scrolling performance
- Built-in Flutter optimization

### Animation Performance
**Decision**: Respect reduced motion preferences
**Rationale**:
- Accessibility requirement
- Better user experience
- Reduces motion sickness
- Battery life improvement

## Security Decisions

### Local Storage: flutter_secure_storage
**Decision**: Use flutter_secure_storage for sensitive data
**Rationale**:
- Encrypted storage on device
- Platform-specific security
- Better than SharedPreferences for sensitive data
- Industry standard approach

### Network Security: HTTPS Only
**Decision**: Require HTTPS for all network calls
**Rationale**:
- Data encryption in transit
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- Industry best practice
- Required for app store approval

## Development Decisions

### Code Organization: Feature-Based
**Decision**: Organize code by features rather than layers
**Rationale**:
- Easier to find related code
- Better team collaboration
- Scalable architecture
- Clear feature boundaries

### Testing Strategy: Golden Tests
**Decision**: Use golden tests for UI components
**Rationale**:
- Visual regression testing
- Multiple text scale testing
- Theme consistency verification
- Automated visual validation

### Documentation: Markdown
**Decision**: Use Markdown for documentation
**Rationale**:
- Easy to read and write
- Version control friendly
- GitHub integration
- Team collaboration

## Trade-offs Made

### Development Speed vs. Code Quality
**Trade-off**: Prioritized getting core features working with good code quality
**Impact**: Slightly longer initial development, but better maintainability

### Feature Completeness vs. MVP
**Trade-off**: Focused on core NDIS features with placeholder for advanced features
**Impact**: Faster time to market, but some features marked as "coming soon"

### Custom Components vs. Material Components
**Trade-off**: Built custom components for better accessibility and branding
**Impact**: More development time, but better user experience and compliance

### Real Backend vs. Mock Data
**Trade-off**: Used mock data for initial development
**Impact**: Faster development, but need to integrate real APIs later

## Future Considerations

### State Management Migration
**Consideration**: Migrate to Riverpod when app complexity increases
**Timeline**: When team size grows or state management becomes complex

### Backend Integration
**Consideration**: Replace mock data with real NDIS APIs
**Timeline**: After core features are stable and tested

### Offline Support
**Consideration**: Add comprehensive offline functionality
**Timeline**: After basic features are complete

### Multi-language Support
**Consideration**: Add internationalization support
**Timeline**: Based on user demand and market expansion
