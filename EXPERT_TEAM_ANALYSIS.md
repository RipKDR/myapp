# üë• **Expert Team Analysis - NDIS App Enhancement Strategy**

## **Team Discussion & Consensus**

### üé® **UX/UI Designer Analysis:**
*"The app has strong foundations with enhanced screens already implementing modern design patterns. However, I see opportunities for better visual consistency, improved user flows, and more delightful microinteractions across all screens."*

### üè• **Healthcare Specialist Review:**
*"NDIS compliance is critical. We need to ensure all screens support the unique workflows of participants, providers, and supporters. Missing features include plan review workflows, goal tracking integration, and better accessibility documentation."*

### ‚ôø **Accessibility Expert Assessment:**  
*"Current screens show good WCAG compliance awareness, but we can enhance voice navigation, improve screen reader semantics, and add more customization options for users with diverse needs."*

### ‚ö° **Performance Engineer Evaluation:**
*"The enhanced components look sophisticated but we need to ensure smooth 60fps animations, efficient memory usage, and optimal loading patterns. Some screens may need performance optimizations."*

### üìã **Product Manager Strategy:**
*"We have a solid foundation but missing key features that would make this truly comprehensive: emergency contacts, medication tracking, appointment reminders, offline sync, and better onboarding flow."*
